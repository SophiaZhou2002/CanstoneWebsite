      <h2>1. Discovery & Feasibility</h2>
      <div class="about-line"></div>
      <p>At Canstone Development, we understand that building a custom home starts with a deep understanding of your vision and needs. That’s why our first step is to meet with you, the client, to discuss your dreams and aspirations for your future home.</p>
      <p>During this initial consultation, we take the time to listen, understand, and get to know you on a personal level. We value your input and work closely with you to ensure that your custom home reflects your unique style and preferences.</p>
      <p>In addition, we conduct a comprehensive feasibility study of the project. This assessment helps us evaluate the practicality and viability of your ideas, taking into account factors such as budget, timeline, and local regulations.</p>
      <p>By combining our expertise with your vision, we create a solid foundation for a successful custom home project.</p>

    <p>Once your design is finalized and selections are made, we provide a fixed price for your project — not a rough estimate, but a firm commitment. You’ll know exactly what to expect, with no hidden surprises.</p>
    <p>Then, we begin construction. Our process is built around clear schedules, consistent updates, and quality craftsmanship at every stage. From the foundation to the final finishes, we keep you informed and involved, ensuring your home is delivered on time, on budget, and exactly how you envisioned it.
